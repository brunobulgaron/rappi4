# rappi4
[Live Demo] (http://hamilton-rappi4.surge.sh/)

## About
When we were learning how to use ReactJS at Labenu (former Future4), we've had an assignment of creating our own version of a food ordering app based on Rappi, and so it was born rappi4.

## Stack :computer:
Front-End: ReactJS, NodeJS, Redux and Material UI.
The project consumes an API created by Labenu's teachers specifically for the students to use.
